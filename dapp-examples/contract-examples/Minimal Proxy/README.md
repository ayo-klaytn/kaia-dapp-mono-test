# EIP-1167 Minimal Proxy Contract
## This repository contains a master contract that is cloned and deployed using an EIP-1167 minimal Proxy contract
### Rather than deploying an entire contract for each user or operation, incurring high gas fees, a cost-effective approach involves deploying a minimal proxy contract that references the existing full contract already present on the blockchain.
