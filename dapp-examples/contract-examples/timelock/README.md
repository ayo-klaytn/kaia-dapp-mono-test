# Simple Timelock Contract
## This repository contains an ERC20 CONTRACT that makes use of a Timelock Contract
### The provided code is a Solidity smart contract named SimpleTimelock. It implements a time-locked mechanism for an ERC20 token. A time-lock mechanism ensures that certain actions can only occur after a specific amount of time has passed. This contract uses OpenZeppelin libraries for safe operations with ERC20 tokens and mathematical calculations
